Vim configuration file for *macOS*

Made from the nice enough [maximum-awesome](https://github.com/square/maximum-awesome) and merging it 
with my original [Linux configuration](https://github.com/mfournialvimLinux).

The result is a very functional Vim environment that benefits from the iTerm2 functions

# What you can't get out of the box in this repo
## Font
I'm using a nice sleek font called [iosevka](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka) that is very thin and
horizontally condensed, which is essential for me
## Lightbar
The cool separators takens from the powerbar plugin for Vim require some work, it's the worse really.
Unless you know how to use Fontpatcher on Mac I recommend the other one they talk about on Lightbar doc,
I used it for Linux without sudo rights and it worked just fine.
## iTerm2
Classic I would say, the default shortcuts work fine with what we already have.

> So many people use Vim and Ruby (was literally in every website I was going through), is Ruby really the best?

# Known bugs and issues
The maximum-awesome integration can fail at any moment if some plugins that I don't know about update 
in the background
